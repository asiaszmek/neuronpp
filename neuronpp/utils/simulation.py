        Create an object to control the simulation.

        After creating the object and execure run() for the first time - the NEURON simulator
        will be init_simulation(). You can also reset the simulator whether you want calling
        init_simulation() method.

        :param init_v
            initial value in mV for the neuron function finitialize().
            In many cases it is -70 mV but you need to specify it explicitely.
            If left None it will take h.v_init param as default init_v.
        :param dt
            value of the fundamental integration time step, dt, used by fadvance().
            When a value is entered into the field editor it is rounded down so that an integral
            multiple of fadvanceâ€™s make up a SingleStep.

            With constant_timestep=False, the dt arg, fadvance returns at t+dt, it means that any
            variable timestep choose by the simulator is computed as next_timestep+dt.
        :param warmup
            in ms, default is 0 ms. Warmup is executed during the first call of run() method,
            before executing the first run.

            By default dt during warmup is warmup/10, so there will be 10 steps during warmup,
            however due to param constant_timestep, the number of steps and their size may vary.
            You can also define custom dt for warmup by warmup_dt param
        :param init_sleep
            sleep time in seconds. To sleep before first run.
            It performs time.sleep(init_sleep) before the first run.
        :param shape_plots:
            a list of objects returned by the function utils.utils.make_shape_plot().
            It allows to create shape plots in NEURON GUI
        :param constant_timestep
            Default is True. Decide if you want a constant timestep of the simulation.

            Multi order variable time step integration method which may be used in place of the
            default staggered fixed time step method. The performance benefits can be substantial
            (factor of more than 10) for problems in which all states vary slowly for long periods
            of time between fast spikes.

            With constant_timestep=False, the dt arg, fadvance returns at t+dt, it means that any
            variable timestep choose by the simulator is computed as next_timestep+dt.
